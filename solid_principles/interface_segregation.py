The interface segregation principle states that an interface should be as small a possible in terms of cohesion. In other words, it should do ONE thing.

An interface is a description of behaviors that an object can do. For example, when you press the power button on the TV remote control, it turns the TV on, and you donâ€™t need to care how.
